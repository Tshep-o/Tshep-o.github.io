    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
      Your privacy is important to me and as such Repetita does not knowingly or
      intentionally collect any data from you, and quite frankly it would be a
      little weird if it did as the app itself does not need to collect any of
      your data in order to work.
      <br />
      <br />
      This policy is effective as of 9 December 2019.
